> [!tldr]
> As an educator, coach, manager and entrepreneur I worked on developing skills for effective communication.

# As an educator

We had subjects on communication and I used them on my internship.

# As a coach

We had to apply academic knowledge about communication on the field, applying psychology (individual and social) to get the most out of each player and also of each group (social/groups dynamics).

# As a manager

To lead entire teams, minimize conflicts and make the process efficient I had to be better every time.

# As an entrepreneur

1. First with the first customers through the empathetic methods of design thinking and psychology to really understand their needs, not just explicit communication, but their real pains, objections, fears and desires.
2. Later leading people to join and engage early members to the team and have effective communication to make things work.
3. Then to reach the market we had to do the two types of communication
	1. Marketing: to attract people by make them see our value proposition
	2. Sales: to help them find their problem and by see if our solution can help them have a better life.

# International toastmasters club

I was a cofounder of the International Vitoria-Gasteiz Toastmasters Club, focused on public speaking and leadership.

# Communication tools and media

I have worked with many communications tools, project management software, collaborative knowledge systemsâ€¦ and we have learned from mistakes to minimize the over or under use of tools depending on the people in each community/group/team.

Tools should be an aid not a end.
