> I worked on objective selection and in coach criteria based systems.

I developed a system, based on some characteristics of the ELO system, to classify the players. This was an alternative proposal for the Rioja's Pelota Federation when they wanted to change the previous system based only on the coaches' criteria, because that system brought many conflicts with the players.

*Federations building*

I also managed the selection of players as a sports director and as a coach in the clubs where I worked. In addition, I had to learn how to establish clear criteria, defined in advance and communicate them to the players to avoid conflicts and try to get everyone to push in the same direction. Usually, I tried to involve the players and other managers in this process.

Other times I had to do it on my own because I was assigned with this particular constraint.
