With this in mind and by want win-win relationship I only can want to have integrity behaviors and try to convince others to have them too, because is better for us in the long term.

Why I would like a short win if this will cost me all the next bigger rewards?
If I grow more I can help you grow more, and if you grow more, you can help me grow more.
