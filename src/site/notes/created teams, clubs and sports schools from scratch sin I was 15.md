I created teams, sports schools and clubs since I was 15.
- Three pelota schools
- One club
- Helping in the creation of 2 more clubs
- Becoming the **youngest** President of an entity in Europe (18 years and 0 days old
- Built many teams and training groups
- Organized many promotional events
- Creation of private tournaments

On this projects, some of them ran by myself and others in collaboration with the Federation, the starting were from scratch and we achieved full functional and autonomous institutions with supporters base, sponsorships, executive team, training staffs, events...
