I was educated in all the modalities of Pelota, more than the ones that the International Federation of Basque Pelota recognizes by now. It was in all courses about Pelota that I did and also in my Degree in the University of Basque Country.

I also shared some courses with some Olympics championships of different modalities and some shared projects with a few of them.
