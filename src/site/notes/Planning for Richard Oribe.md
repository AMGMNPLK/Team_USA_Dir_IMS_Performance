I had as a teacher Javier Aymerich, who was the coach of Richard Oribe, who won sixteen medals in the Paralympic Summer Games between 1996 and 2012. I did the training specialization (from initiation to high performance level) and planned the trainings with Javier Aymerich's supervision and feedback.

I was able to enjoy watching Richard win, they were very nice and emotional moments.
