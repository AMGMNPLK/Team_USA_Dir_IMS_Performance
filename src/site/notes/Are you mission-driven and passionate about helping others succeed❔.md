> I discovered that my mission was helping other to succeed.

The first years of my career I tried to build things to help myself, because I wanted to be better, to better myself as much as possible. On this path I discovered that there are other ways to be better by helping others.  
  
I started late as a player because my environment was not very developed in terms of training young people, I have this psychological need, almost traumatic, to compensate for that lack of sufficient success as a player, obsessing about winning. Maybe, with the right means, I wouldn't have succeeded either, but not having had that opportunity is what I live with as a frustration.  
  
And because of those early experiences I mentioned earlier, I discovered that I can get my selfish share of success by being part of the success of others, being part of the winning team, helping that team get to the top.  
  
So, from a very young age, I focused my efforts on being a coach and manager.  
  
However, while my desire to win may not be the healthiest for me, I do try to make it as healthy as possible for others. I have had to work on my psychological and stoic training to be able to deal with myself and that I think has helped me to be a support to others.  
  
So I always try to focus my efforts on proactive tasks that bring out the best in each player in the healthiest way possible.
