> I had the opportunity to be selected to study the Master in High Performance Training by the Spanish Olympic Committee.

This Master's Degree has few vacancies and is in great demand by professionals from all Spanish-speaking countries, so they are very demanding in choosing the most deserving students.

Besides learning from some of the best professors, scientists and specialists, I was able to share these lessons with many of the best coaches of different sports as classmates.  
  
I was also able to live from inside this institution how the Olympics work, feel the Olympic spirit, attend some of the events about the organization, experiences, athletes' lives, masterclasses and specialized symposiums as extracurricular activities.
