I had as professor to Javier Aymerich, who was the coach of Richard Oribe, who won sixteen medals at the Paralympic Summer Games between 1996 and 2012. I did the speciallization of training (from initiation to high performance level) and I planned trainnings with the supervision and feedback of Javier Aymerich.

I could enjoy a lot seeing Richard win, they were very beautiful and emotional moments.
