I have been very fortunate because I felt in love of sports thank you to this player, Tit√≠n III. He was my idol when I was a child, but, when I was eleven, in a final, the best match ever, he lost against the best player till those moment.

Again, an unsatisfied deprivation appear in my life. That moment of deprivation of the winning, but the euphoria of seen that beauty in a match. That contrast of feelings, and almost a Stendhal Syndrome, made my **fall in love of this sport**.

Fortunately, I had the opportunity to train with him when I was a late teenager and, later, to **be his coach** and even participate in the achievement of his last championship, who played by pairs with [[the club with best success rate#Merino II|Merino II]], one of the other players that we trained:

By remembering those moments I'm getting emotional.
