> Coach in the club with the best success rate

Ezcaray Pelota Club achieved the best rate of professional players, some of them became the main players in their positions and achieved the most important competitions in the world. They 6 represented those years 12-14% of the total number of professional players while our club used to have about 35-40 players in total. The next team represented was [Oberena](https://oberena.org/pelota/) which used to have about 160 players and they had about 3 professional players, 6-7% of the total professional players.



The success rate was about:

**Ezcaray: 15%**

vs

**Oberena: 1,9%**

Too many good years those, it will be difficult to repeat them.

One of them, like Merino II, was also the best in his position for a while and many of them achieved some [[LEPM|LEPM]] championships as you can check in their Wikipedia pages. Dario is the latest talent of our club.
