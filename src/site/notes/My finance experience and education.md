*Interview about investment & finance*

Because of [[My trajectory as manager|my education and trajectory on management]] and also because I wanted to learn more about this important area I studied some courses on finance and economy and I started my modest career as a value investor (what I had to delegate to focus on my core value proposition).

I also worked part time those days on a private investors club in charge of the dealflow, advisory, investor relationship and management of the investments on startups and small businesses.

The rest of my experience on finance has been as CEO of my company and startups.
